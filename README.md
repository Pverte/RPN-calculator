A RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator made for a course from high school in Python

 ## To-do list :
 [ ] Upload the code without the GUI
 
 [ ] Create a GUI version calculator like
 
 For fun :
 
 [ ] Make a converter "normal" equation <-> RPN equation
 
 [ ] Create a real time stack GUI to show how it work
